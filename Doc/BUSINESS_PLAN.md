# WhytChat V1 Business Plan & Vision

## 🎯 Vision Statement

To democratize secure, local AI by providing a powerful desktop application that combines the capabilities of modern LLMs with a privacy-first "Global Library" architecture. WhytChat empowers users to build a personal knowledge base that lives entirely on their own hardware.

## 🔑 Value Proposition

1.  **Absolute Privacy**: "Your data, your machine." Ideal for enterprises, lawyers, developers, and anyone dealing with sensitive data.
2.  **Global Library Workflow**: Unlike competitors that silo files into single chats, WhytChat's library lets you curate a persistent knowledge base.
3.  **Offline Capability**: Reliability in any environment, with no API downtimes or rate limits.
4.  **Split View Intelligence** (Planned): A UI optimized for deep work, allowing users to analyze documents side-by-side with AI insights.
